it helps to remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transports it to the liver for metabolism.  This is accomplished through 2 different pathways.  In the direct pathway, HDL delivers cholesterol esters directly to the liver via a scavenger receptor (SCARB1) on the hepatocyte cell membrane.  In the indirect pathway, the cholesterol in HDL is transferred to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein.</p><p>Nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation help to raise HDL levels and have significant cardiovascular benefits.  In contrast, use of medications to raise HDL levels does <strong>not</strong> improve cardiovascular outcomes.  Pharmacologic treatment of patients with low HDL levels should focus on lowering LDL cholesterol with <strong>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors</strong> (statins), as these are the most effective lipid-lowering drugs for preventing cardiovascular events.  Statins are indicated for secondary prevention in all patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, <strong>regardless</strong> of baseline lipid levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>  Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, but evidence for reduction in cardiovascular events is mixed, and benefits over statin monotherapy are likely minimal.  It may be considered for patients who cannot take statins due to significant hepatotoxicity or myopathy, or who have very high LDL levels despite statin therapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>  Cationic exchange resins (eg, cholestyramine) decrease LDL cholesterol by interfering with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.  Bile acid binding resins can significantly increase triglyceride levels in patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia.  In addition, cationic exchange resins have not been proven to prevent cardiac events.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>  Omega-3 essential fatty acids are sometimes used for hyperlipidemia treatment.  They cause a decrease in serum triglycerides and a slight increase in HDL concentration but do not appear to significantly reduce cardiovascular events.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>  Niacin (vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font>) given in pharmacologic doses is the most effective agent for raising HDL levels, but does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and is associated with adverse effects (eg, flushing, hyperglycemia).  It is primarily used for patients who have failed other lipid-lowering drugs.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>  Fibrates activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha, a transcription factor that increases lipoprotein lipase activity.  Fibrates decrease triglyceride levels and raise HDL levels.  However, fibrates are inferior to statins for reducing cardiovascular events and are primarily used to prevent pancreatitis in patients with very high triglyceride levels.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br/>Although low HDL concentration is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, the use of medications to raise HDL levels does not improve cardiovascular outcomes.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) lower total cholesterol and LDL levels.  Statins are the most effective lipid-lowering drugs for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline lipid levels.</p>"},{"id":9,"uworldid":106780,"header":"","stem":"<p>A 15-month-old boy is brought to the clinic for evaluation of recurrent mouth ulcers.  Over the past 5 months, his mother has noted that he has had periodic episodes of mouth pain and oral ulcers.  She says the episodes usually last for a couple of days and then resolve without intervention.  The boy has no known medical conditions and takes no medications.  Vital signs are normal.  Examination shows mucositis.  The rest of the examination is unremarkable.  Complete blood count (CBC) reveals an absolute neutrophil count of 390/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>.  Hemoglobin level and platelet count are normal.  Serial CBC results are documented over the next 6 weeks, revealing the pattern shown below:</p><p></p><p>The patient returns to the clinic on Day 39.  Examination of this patient's bone marrow would most likely reveal an abnormal increase in which of the following?</p>","options":["A.

dissection</strong>.  Uncontrolled <strong>hypertension</strong>, suggested by the patient's nonadherence with medical therapy and ECG evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, is the strongest risk factor for aortic dissection.</p><p>With each LV contraction, the ejected stroke volume rapidly increases aortic pressure and generates shear stress on the aortic wall.  Medical therapy for aortic dissection is aimed at <strong>reducing aortic wall shear stress</strong> to limit extension of the dissection.  This is accomplished via <strong>anti-impulse therapy</strong> to decrease the rate of change in aortic blood pressure per time (ie, reduce dP/dt).</p><p><strong>Esmolol</strong> is a selective <strong>beta-1 receptor blocker</strong> that is given by intravenous infusion.  It is first-line therapy for acute aortic dissection as it has a short half-life (allowing for easy dose titration) and reduces shear stress in 2 ways:</p><ul><li><p>Negative inotropy <strong>decreases LV contraction velocity</strong>.  This decreases the rate of blood ejection and reduces stroke volume <strong>(Choice E)</strong> to decrease the rise in blood pressure with each contraction (ie, decreased rate and magnitude of blood pressure change).</p></li><li><p>Negative chronotropy <strong>decreases heart rate</strong>, subjecting the aortic wall to fewer LV contractions per minute (ie, decreased number of blood pressure changes).</p></li></ul><p>Once shear stress has been minimized with adequate reduction in LV contractility and heart rate, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) to further reduce blood pressure is also beneficial.  Because esmolol has little effect on PVR <strong>(Choice C)</strong>, vasodilators (eg, nitroprusside, nicardipine) may be added for this purpose.  Vasodilators should never be given prior to a negative chronotropic agent because vasodilation causes reflex tachycardia that increases aortic wall shear stress.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>  Reduced LV contractility and heart rate decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  Although this is the major goal of medical therapy for treating myocardial ischemia, reducing aortic wall shear stress is much more important for treating aortic dissection.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>  Reduced LV contractility and heart rate may slightly increase LV filling pressure (due to less blood being ejected with each contraction and increased LV filling time), but this effect is of minimal consequence in treating aortic dissection.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br/>The primary goal of medical therapy for acute aortic dissection is to reduce aortic wall shear stress by minimizing the change in aortic blood pressure per time (dP/dt).  Esmolol, a selective beta-1

and identify DNA fragments, proteins, mRNA, and DNA-bound proteins, respectively.  The same basic technique underlies all of the blot procedures.  First, the unknown sample is separated by gel electrophoresis.  Separation occurs based on a molecule's size and charge.  The separated molecules form bands on the gel that are then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a labeled probe to identify the specific DNA fragment, RNA molecule, or protein of interest.</p><p> Southwestern blots are used to identify and isolate proteins that bind DNA.  In this technique, the target protein binds to a labeled, double-stranded DNA probe that is homologous to the protein’s regulatory sequence.  Of the molecules listed, c-Jun is the only DNA-binding protein.  c-Jun and c-Fos are nuclear transcription factors that directly bind DNA via a leucine zipper motif.  The genes that code for c-Jun and c-Fos are proto-oncogenes, genes that can become oncogenes following a mutation or with constitutive expression.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>  Ras is a proto-oncogene that codes for a membrane-bound G-protein.  This G-protein acts as a secondary mediator for several hormones and cytokines that act on cell membrane receptors.  Ras activation activates the MAP kinase pathway and ultimately affects transcription.  However, Ras itself does not bind directly to DNA.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and E)</strong>  The β1-adrenergic receptor is a classic G<font size=\"2\">s</font>-protein-coupled receptor located in the cell membrane.  It does not interact directly with DNA.  Adenylyl cyclase is the enzyme that cleaves ATP to form cAMP, the second messenger associated with G<sub><font size=\"2\">s</font></sub>-protein-coupled receptors.  cAMP activates protein kinase A for further downstream signaling.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>  S-100 proteins are homodimeric calcium-binding proteins, similar in structure to calmodulin and important in intracellular functions such as protein phosphorylation and cell growth and differentiation.  S-100 is a marker for cells of neural crest derivation (melanocytes and Schwann cells), as well as Langerhans cells and other dendritic cells.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br/>Southwestern blotting is used to detect DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors, nucleases, and
